Scroll bars for both directions would be easier to understand than arrows.

55eda0b3-163d-49e2-8063-257d765a6847,multi,multi_improve,Sometimes less is more and I think it is easier to use a platform with a simplistic intuitive design than having to many possibilities when trying to just browse and not knowing too specifically where you want to get. 
56627cf8-2ec4-41e5-8a4c-4e65be62cb41,multi,multi_what_works,"innovative way of filtering in matrix-like style, good to include two parameters at once, but in the long run hidden cell with all the results is a little inconvenient."
6845ae9e-08f7-4642-860e-249139a5f885,multi,multi_what_works,I liked that it categorized the hotels in a nice way. I usually care about the price and the rating and this way i could easily find group of acommodations that could suit me.

70c25238-510a-4071-bd0c-8495ccca678b,multi,multi_improve,I dont know. I think it is too complicated and not intuitive enough. But maybe that is just because I have never seen/used this type of browsing.

Now that I see the explanation in the evaluation, I understand it and perhaps could have used it better.

8f77b2d0-9f68-4e33-9133-eddc537c73e8,multi,multi_improve,"It really works for me, well done and so different to the ones that we've already known. But to be honest I like the second way of searching the most (booking-type) and multi-directional interface after this one."

2. search by multiple parameters, e.g. distance from the center"
aaece07b-b498-490d-a4a2-7c0c80782feb,multi,multi_improve,"Many of the interface options are not clear to a person who has not used this way of booking. It is only after some time that many options are discovered, but who has time for that. I suspect that the use of intelligent, AI-supported clouds with descriptions, suggestions for using the most useful options would help. A second option would be to start in phases: first type, select basic filters and data: place, time, hotel type and basic requirements. Then only enters this filtering system to narrow down the best choices.

All in all, I think that this way is not very useful looking that it concerns the topic of making travel bookings."
aba196a9-b65f-4115-9f51-986d115d77f2,multi,multi_what_works,It was helpful to find cheap accommodations but with ok reviews. In other words it was easy to find sweet spot in two filters that I care about
aba196a9-b65f-4115-9f51-986d115d77f2,multi,multi_improve,In two directional browsing I wouldn't show one of the accommodations in each category but rather a range of parameters that represent every accommodation in this category.

how about instead of seeing a 3x3 grid you would see elements scattered on a surface of a sphere? it would be less jumpy and could be distributed linearly instead of binned into groups "

Also were low rating very popular in the displayed results at the start of a search which also let me go to the high ratings first, cause why should i want to worst offering. also being able to scroll beyond the boarders or beyond very high so to speak didn't make sense to me. it should be a fixed matrix where i move and not an infinity matrix. Also then to open a cell so to speak to find more items that are similiar felt a bit unefficient."
