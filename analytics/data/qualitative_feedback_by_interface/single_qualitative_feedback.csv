Add extra filtering options after selecting the first group (e.g. after selecting the price range, show a similar menu for distance and rating).

6845ae9e-08f7-4642-860e-249139a5f885,single,single_title_filter_feedback,That it's very clear and easy to use.
6845ae9e-08f7-4642-860e-249139a5f885,single,single_title_filter_improve,"I guess I would still use double categories here - so find a persona (for example young, single traveler) and make a category for that person (with hostels, single rooms). Cause filtering only by rating is too narrow. "

70c25238-510a-4071-bd0c-8495ccca678b,single,single_what_works,The show the list button. I feel like scrolling left/right you dont have a really good overview of the options and how many there are. Scrolling a list up/down feels way quicker and easier.
70c25238-510a-4071-bd0c-8495ccca678b,single,single_title_filter_feedback,It is nice if you have a specific category in mind that you want to filter. If you want to place multiple filters in my opinion it is not that useful.
70c25238-510a-4071-bd0c-8495ccca678b,single,single_title_filter_improve,I prefer when it is possible to set multiple filters at once with one list view of results. Maybe putting several titles next to each other.

8d50a960-fef3-4721-bfe1-76c5cae9dae7,single,single_title_filter_feedback,I didn't like it.
8d50a960-fef3-4721-bfe1-76c5cae9dae7,single,single_title_filter_improve,I missed distance to the city center filter.

af333a5b-e51b-441e-8191-c300e5ccf9f6,single,single_what_works,"The categorization of different categories was useful. For instance having budget, medium and expensive price for the price category."

c12ff853-b429-47ad-8ce3-02b04ebc559a,single,single_what_works,I think it's nice to explore different options depending on one's most important criteria.
c12ff853-b429-47ad-8ce3-02b04ebc559a,single,single_title_filter_feedback,Very efficient to search over the desired price range (as it sets automatically relevant price ranges).
c12ff853-b429-47ad-8ce3-02b04ebc559a,single,single_title_filter_improve,Not being able to filter among multiple criteria is for me a limitation in the case of searching for something specific. So I would maybe add a sorting criterion among each list.

c829072d-50a1-401d-9d8c-bab9c62cb632,single,single_what_works,"Categories of accommodation (distance, price etc) reminded me of movie genres in Netflix and made it easy, playful."
